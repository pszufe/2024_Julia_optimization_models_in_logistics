Data analysis has become one of the core processes in virtually any professional activity. The collection of data becomes easier and less expensive, so we have ample access to it.

In this workshop we will use the Julia language. This language has been designed to address the typical challenges that data scientists face when using other tools. Julia is like Python and Matlab in that it supports an efficient and convenient development process. However, at the same time, programs developed in Julia have performance comparable to C.
This is partticularly important

This workshop does not require the participants to have prior detailed knowledge of operations research and optimization nor the Julia programming language.
What we assume is a basic knowledge of data science tools (like Python or R) and some understanding of basic algebra and statistics.
